Contsys clinical modelling
==========================

Resources related to the development of clinical information model components aligned to the ISO 1340 System of Concepts to support continuity of care (Contsys).

The aim is to develop a set of archetypes and templates which best represent an approach to implementation of the Contsys concepts within an EHR. 

The archetypes have been developed against the openEHR reference model.

This work is being carried out as part of the EU SemanticHealthNet project.
